# Maclaurin-Series
Maclaurin series are the way that familiar mathematical functions are actually calculated in a digital computer. The approximation increases in accuracy as the number of terms 𝑛 in the summation gets bigger. The series approximation is only valid for −1 < 𝑥 < 1.

Write a program to request a value of 𝑥 from the user and the number of terms N. The program then evaluates the N terms of the Maclaurin series. For example, your program should produce the following
output.
Enter a value of x to evaluate: 0.5
Enter number of terms of Maclaurin series : 4
Maclaurin series for loge(1+0.5) with 4 terms = 0.401041
